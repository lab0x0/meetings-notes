# Summary

1. Jeremy elected money collector, needs open bank card, buy new sim card, get new telephone. 
@Janek (or anybody) can you donate one of you Android phones?

3. List of coming activity

Any other suggestions?
We need @李泽江 help for weldering workshop. 几天你可以帮助我们[愉快]

4.  the current status with renting.
There is no companied who interested our two rooms.
Small room - 3500
Study room - 6000
Can @Jeremy He , @李泽江 put all info to special web sites?

5. The current status with coming sponsors in October. I can organize meetups with makerorigin and Thunder laser. Output could be ~2000 rmb
But would like to get members help. It this case it make me more motivated.
If you know any potential meetup sponsor give me a contact.

6. @Alexey Zaytsev want to build tables for LZ. LZ agree give 250 rmb for build one table and check result. Total we need 8+ tables
Also it supposed to be welding workshop in LZ with Alexey organization.
Now we need help to recharge Argon bottle in Baoan near airport.

7. Everybody agree we need spend some time to organize storage and other stuff in LZ.
Every Sunday evening we will have cleaning day. We will spend 2-3 hours time for it.
So every Sunday evening we have members meetup.
After members meetup we have cleaning time.


8. We need upgrade light box logo.
- @Alexey Zaytsev will buy black paint and try to fix it.
- if result will be not acceptable, we will use vinyl cutting.

9. Need to put LZ info for hacker-macker sites. @Abed Bukhari  please send me link on sites where  you already published our info.

10. The current member's default storage limit will be 1/2 shelf.
If member use more, we need talk to him and find the way how to reduce about of stuff member keep in LZ (keep it in your home or throw away). 
All of this should be individualy discuss between member and community on members meetings. 
Member can pay for additional storage or find another way how convince community.
The basic principle, members can keep private stuff on their table,  under table, in 1/2 shelf, in other storage area if we introduce it.
All other space is public.
By default all stuff which is located in public area have Free to use policy.
Members can keep things which belong to them in public aria. They can give those things their own policy. Please inform people via labels.
For example: 
"Need ask before use"
"Use but keep organised"
"If you used a lot please order more" (for materials, disposables)
Basic principle. Don't keep you private stuff in public aria if you not allow to use it.
If you keep stuff in private aria and allow to use it. It's not counting in your storage limit.
Feel free to share all you stuff. [微笑]
I think we need draw 2D/ LZ plan with actual furniture and equipment sizes. It will help us a lot to organize it better. Who can do it?

11. We decided introduce a new membership type.
"Foreign member"
250 rmb / month
This person not stay in LZ, but he has the same storage as usual member. No right to vote in committee.
Also this person can use our postal address to receive parcels. We also can forward some parcel  for him to his country if he ask us.
This new type will be suitable for temporary leaved members, for foreign makers who need some remote "office" in China, for supporters, who already pay a little every month and be part of our community.
